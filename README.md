# Simplicity PHP Framework
This is *Simple* PHP Framework started as Login with templates. I am currently turning it into a more evolved framework to simplify dweb development. 

The framework is meant to centralize code I have used on other projects to maximize reuse and turbo charge development

**Primary Folders**:
- **src** directory: Simplicity Framework Files
    - **SimpleAuth**: a simple auth library for providing authentication
    - **SimpleTemplate**: a simple theme engine
    - **SimpleForm**: a simple form engine
    - **SimpleDebug**: a collapsible prettier alternative to print_r
    - **SimpleCache**: caches a file for a specified amount of time
    - **SimpleHttpRequest**: uses curl to fetch a file
    - **CSRF** : Simple CSRF class, see Qrcode demo for example 
- **src/plugins** directory: Plugins for the Simplicity Cms/Plugin Handler
    - **Block** - The basic element on a page is a block, there are multiple types of blocks
    - **TextBlock** - Specific block which provides text
    - **Section** - There can be multiple blocks in one section. Like header, content, footer
    - **Page** - A page is what eventually is served and contains multiple section
    - **Feed** - RSS feed plugin. Fetches and displays RSS Feeds
    - **Folder** - a Folder serves a folder as a route
    - **SimpleTemplate** - Template Provider using simple substitution
    - **TwigTemplate** - Template Provider using Twig as an engine
    - **Menu** - Creates menus
    - **ContentProvider** - Block providing a typical blog
    - **OSZContent** - Default content provider using the open site database as data source

There are more complex frameworks but this is probably as simple as you can get to understand
